##Preparation for work

1. Make sure the LTS version of Node.js is installed on your computer. 
[Download and install]( https://nodejs.org/en/) it if necessary.
2. Set basic dependence on the project with the `npm install` command.
3. Start the authoring mode by executing the `npm start` command.
4. Go to the browser at [http ://localhost: 3000](http://localhost:3000). 
    This page will automatically reload when you save your changes to the project files.

##Expand
The production version of the project will automatically be linted, assembled and deployed on GitHub Pages, in the `gh-pages` branch, whenever the `main` branch is updated. For example, after direct pushu or accepted pool-request. To do this, in the `package.json` edit the `homepage` field, replacing `your_username`and `your_repo_name` on your own, and send the changes to GitHub.

```json
"homepage": "https://your_username.github.io/your_repo_name/"
```
Next, you need to go to the GitHub repository settings (`Settings` > `Pages`) and
expose the distribution of the production version of files from the` /root ` folder of the `gh-pages` branch, if
it was not done automatically.
